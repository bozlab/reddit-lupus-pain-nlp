## ðŸŽ¯Goal
Apply an unsupervised approach (BERTopic) for thematic analysis of pain mentions. Compare/contrast these with our LLM biopsychosocial pain dimensions. This can show us if weâ€™re comprehensive in our approach or if there are others that we arenâ€™t catchingâ€”like other dimensions of pain

- pain_vocabulary_lupus_reddit.xlsx : contains our pain vocabulary lexicon used to identify Reddit r/Lupus and r/LupusSupport posts related to pain. Categorized by coauthors based on lupus-specific pain categories
- Topic Modeling: Code available in /one-sentence/ folder, with details on hyperparameters and topic representation by example documents provided in Topic modeling details.docx
- LLM Information Extraction: Code available in the /LLM structured information extraction/ folder, to be run sequentially (1, 2, 3 as prepended to file names)
- LLM evaluation reliability calculation code: the analysis used to determine interrater reliability for LLM evaluation is the R Markdown file, llm_lupus_evaluation_reliability_code.Rmd
